<!-- To put on github do git push origin main. -->
<!-- When changing something, do add <filename>, commit -m "<what changed>" -->

<!-- GitHub allows you to publish web projects directly from a GitHub repository: -->
    <!-- Go to GitHub repo. -->
    <!-- Click on the Settings button from the panel at the top. -->
    <!-- Click on Pages on the left side bar. -->
    <!-- Change the Source from none to main branch and click Save. -->
    <!-- It may take a few minutes (the GitHub website says up to 10, but we’ve seen 
        it take up to an hour. Do not add a “theme” to your project, or you may have 
        git conflicts, instead, be patient.) but your project should be accessible over 
        the web from your-github-username.github.io/your-github-repo-name (obviously 
        substituting your own details in the link). -->
